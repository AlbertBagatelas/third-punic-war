# The Third Punic War
The aim of this website is to provide information to the user about The Third Punic War.
This war which happened between the year 149 BC - 146 BC between the Romans and the Carthaginians.
I am for this site to be user friendly and be responsive to all types of devices that may be used, for example phones and tablets as well as computers and laptops.

## Goals
* My Goal is to reach for a more mature target audience for the website.
* One of the goals is for the website to a quick but informative read to ensure that the user understands the basis of the war.
* Another of my goals is to make the user think about why the war happened.
* Another goal is to show that the Romans didnt do all good, even though they did bring many benifts to the world like roads and aqueduct systems, they aren't always shown within the media or school with the worse aspects of their lively hood, like with the end of this war with the complete destruction of Carthage and it's people.
* Another goal is for the website to have videos on it to provide a visuale and audio learning to the user.

## The Design!
* Fonts used!
    * The font used throughout the website for the headings is Shadows Into Light, this is to bring a more handwritten feel to    the project which I feel brings a more old fashioned style to the website.
    * The font used throughout the website for the main paragraphs is Montserrat, which brings a clean look to the main writting to ensure the reader's full understanding of the content.
    * The fallback font used incase of the other two not being able to be utilised by certain devices is sans-serif, which will ensure a clean look to the website for full reader's understanding of the content.
* Colours used!
    * The main colours used are black, grey, white, dark gold, and a little pink. I feel that these colours work well with the images used, and help capture the theme of the website which i feel represents the colours that would have be present at the time.
* Images/Videos used!
    * The images used throughout the website I believe help to capture the purpose of the website, and show what the Thrid Punic War was like.
    * The Youtube videos used help to inform the user with more information, and gives the user a good reading/cideo balance to keep the user intrested.
* Interactivity Used!
    * The website employs some zooming effects to the different elements throughout the site, for example the main image zooms as you enter the website and for each page change, furthermore, as the information holders and navigation are hovered over they zoom out for effect. This is done to add some user interactivity to help the user keep invested in the website.
* The information boxes!
    * The information boxes that have been designed to carry most of the information throughout the website are designed to look like old style tablets that represent the time period better.
