                                There were many casualties throughout the Third Punic War. Although the Roman casualties are unknown, we have a good estimation on the Carthaginians casualties, that being 450 thousand died and around 50 thousand were enslaved!

                            Rome was determined that the city of Carthage remain in ruins. A ten-man commission was despatched by the Senate and Scipio was ordered to carry out further demolitions. A curse was placed on anyone who might attempt to resettle the site in the future.[109] The former site of the city was confiscated as ager publicus, public land.

                            A century after the war Julius Caesar planned to rebuild Carthage as a Roman city, but little work was done. The concept was revived by Augustus in 29 BC, who brought the plan to completion. Roman Carthage had become one of the main cities of Roman Africa by the time of the Empire.
